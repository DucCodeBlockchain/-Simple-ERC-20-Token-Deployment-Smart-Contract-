# üåü Simple ERC-20 Token Deployment Smart Contract üåü

## üìã Introduction

Welcome to the **Simple ERC-20 Token Deployment** project! This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation of a smart contract for deploying an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer or a newcomer to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), this project aims to provide a detailed, step-by-step approach to creating your own token. Let's dive into the fascinating world of smart contracts and token creation! üöÄ

## üìú What is an ERC-20 Token?

ERC-20 is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. This standard defines a set of rules that all Ethereum tokens must follow, ensuring compatibility with various platforms and services. ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is identical and interchangeable with another. This makes them ideal for use in applications such as digital currencies, voting systems, and more.

## üìö Project Overview

In this project, we will:

1. **Set up the development environment**: Install necessary tools and dependencies.
2. **Write the smart contract**: Create a smart contract that adheres to the ERC-20 standard.
3. **Deploy the contract**: Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
4. **Interact with the contract**: Use various methods to interact with the deployed contract.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

To get started, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the tools and dependencies you'll need:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for running scripts and managing packages.
- **npm**: Node package manager for installing dependencies.
- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum.
- **Ganache**: Personal blockchain for Ethereum development.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for managing Ethereum wallets and interacting with DApps.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```

2. **Install Truffle**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g truffle
    ```

3. **Install Ganache**:
    Download and install Ganache from [here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

4. **Set up MetaMask**:
    Install the MetaMask extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing the Smart Contract

We'll be using Solidity, a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

### ERC-20 Token Contract

Here's a simple ERC-20 token contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **SPDX-License-Identifier**: Specifies the license for the contract.
- **pragma solidity ^0.8.0**: Specifies the Solidity compiler version.
- **import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"**: Imports the ERC-20 implementation from OpenZeppelin, a popular library for secure smart contract development.
- **contract MyToken is ERC20**: Defines a new contract named `MyToken` that inherits from the `ERC20` contract.
- **constructor(uint256 initialSupply)**: The constructor is called when the contract is deployed. It initializes the token with a name, symbol, and initial supply.

## üöÄ Deploying the Smart Contract

To deploy the contract, we'll use Truffle and Ganache.

### Truffle Configuration

1. **Initialize Truffle**:
    ```bash
    truffle init
    ```

2. **Update `truffle-config.js`**:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        development: {
          host: "127.0.0.1",
          port: 7545,
          network_id: "*", // Match any network id
        },
      },
      compilers: {
        solc: {
          version: "0.8.0", // Fetch exact version from solc-bin
        },
      },
    };
    ```

### Deploy Script

1. **Create Migration Script**:
    In the `migrations` directory, create a new file `2_deploy_contracts.js`:

    ```javascript
    const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

    module.exports = function (deployer) {
      const initialSupply = 1000000; // 1 million tokens
      deployer.deploy(MyToken, initialSupply);
    };
    ```

2. **Compile and Deploy**:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

## üîó Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with your deployed contract using Truffle's console or through a web interface with MetaMask.

### Truffle Console

1. **Open Truffle Console**:
    ```bash
    truffle console
    ```

2. **Interact with the Contract**:
    ```javascript
    let instance = await MyToken.deployed();
    let balance = await instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]);
    console.log(balance.toString());
    ```

### Web Interface

You can create a simple web interface using HTML and JavaScript to interact with your contract through MetaMask. Here's a basic example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>MyToken Interface</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web3@1.3.5/dist/web3.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>MyToken Interface</h1>
  <button id="getBalance">Get Balance</button>
  <p id="balance"></p>

  <script>
    const contractAddress = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
    const abi = YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI;

    window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
      if (window.ethereum) {
        window.web3 = new Web3(ethereum);
        try {
          await ethereum.enable();
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("User denied account access");
        }
      } else if (window.web3) {
        window.web3 = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
      } else {
        console.log('Non-Ethereum browser detected. You should consider trying MetaMask!');
      }

      const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
      document.getElementById('getBalance').onclick = async () => {
        const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
        const balance = await contract.methods.balanceOf(accounts[0]).call();
        document.getElementById('balance').innerText = balance;
      };
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
